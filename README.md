backbone-gallery.js
===================

A small image gallery built in backbone.js.

This gallery is meant to host a small personal image gallery that is easy to setup and maintain.

I created it when setting up a website that was statically generated and has no database.  Therefore all images are loaded via a config object (gallery) and no database is required.

I will update more as time allows, but don't expect much.  Feel free to fork and change as much as you'd like.
